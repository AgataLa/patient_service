# Patient Service

Desktop application that visualize patients transport to hospitals

## Technologies

Java, JavaFX, MAven, JUnit

## About

Application visualize how ambulances transport patients to the nearest hospital that has free beds. To carry out the simulation application needs a file with infrastructure data to create a map. Then you can provide data with patients coordinates in the form of a file or typing in input field. Once patients appear the simulation begans. Application allows to hide hospitals, roads and other objects on a map. You can also change the speed of the simulation.

Application solves some algorithmic problems:
* finding convex hull
* finding intersections of multiple straight lines
* finding the shortest path in a graph
* determining whether a point is inside of convex set or not
* finding the closest point to another point

## How to launch

To start an application run command ```java -jar .\PatientService.jar``` in command prompt.
